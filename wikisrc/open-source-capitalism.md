# Exploring Open Source Capitalism: A Deep Dive into the Intersection of Innovation and Economics

## Defining Open Source Capitalism

**Open Source Capitalism** is an economic and philosophical approach where the principles of [open source software development](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source) intersect with capitalist methodologies. It involves using open source resources to drive business value, innovation, and competition while still adhering to the open source ethos of accessibility and collaboration. Here, capitalism is not just about profit from software but creating economic models around open source that benefit both developers and businesses:

- **Core Concept:** It involves leveraging open source software for commercial gain through services, proprietary extensions, or innovative [licensing models](https://opensource.org/licenses) that still allow for some degree of openness.

- **Incentive Structures:** Unlike traditional capitalism where profit is the primary motivator, here, it might also include recognition, community status, or shared economic benefits.

## Understanding Open Source Capitalism

In the realm of software development, **Open Source Software** was traditionally viewed through a socialist lens with the advent of the [GNU General Public License (GPL)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html). However, the landscape has transformed with licenses like [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) and [Apache](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), broadening and commercializing the scope of open source, giving rise to **Open Source Capitalism**.

## Exploitation in Open Source

The longest enduring model of [open source capitalism](https://github.com/open-compensation-token-license/octl/blob/main/octl-whitepaper.md#introduction) has been leveraging donations to support development. There's a stark disparity between the massive cost savings realized by using open source software and the relatively modest donation costs, resulting in a capitalist open source return on investment factor of 5,294 times. This economic model shows how open source can be both a source of innovation and a significant economic advantage.

## The Economics of Open Source

- **Cost Savings vs. Donations:** The economic benefit of open source to companies is clear, but the compensation for developers remains disproportionately low. Explore more about [unpaid volunteer work](https://www.license-token.com/wiki/unpaid-volunteer-work) in open source.

- **New Licensing Models:** Licenses like the [Open Compensation Token License](http://license-token.com) aim to address this by allowing developers to earn from their contributions, similar to how musicians earn royalties.

## Defining Open Source in a Capitalist Context

Open Source foundations define software as 'open source' when it can be exploited for free, both commercially and non-commercially. New interpretations within **open source capitalism** have scaled this concept into several layers:

1. **Core Code Visibility** - Only the core code is accessible, emphasizing transparency but limiting full access, often seen in [dual-licensing approaches](https://www.license-token.com/wiki/dual-licensing-approach).
2. **Complete Code Access** - The entire codebase is available for viewing, a practice often referred to as [source-available software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-available_software).
3. **Free to Modify and Extend** - Users can change or extend the code without cost, embodying the spirit of open source.
4. **Commercial Use for Free** - Permitting commercial exploitation without fee, which is a core tenet of [Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software).

## New Licenses Reflecting Capitalist Principles

- **Open Compensation Token License (OCTL):** This license introduces a novel approach by allowing parts of the code to be sold, with licensing required for commercial use where royalties are redistributed to the code's owners. This model incentivizes contribution through financial reward, pushing towards a more direct form of **open source capitalism**.

- **Server Side Public License (SSPL):** Ensures that any server software using the code must share its source code publicly, aiming to prevent large corporations from monopolizing community-developed software.

- **Business Source License (BSL):** Allows companies to share software with commercial use restrictions, which then transition to open-source after a set period, fostering initial commercial exclusivity while ensuring eventual open access.

## Further Thoughts for Feedback

- Are these new licenses more reflective of **open source capitalism** than the traditional donation-based model?
- Which license best embodies the spirit of **open source capitalism**, or what criteria should we use to judge the balance between exploiting capitalism and fostering innovation?
- Can **Open Source Capitalism** truly balance the open source ideals of freedom and collaboration with the profit motives of capitalism, or does one inevitably compromise the other?

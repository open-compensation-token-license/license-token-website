        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Arbitrum is a layer-2 scaling solution developed by Offchain Labs that enhances transaction speeds and reduces fees on the Ethereum network by leveraging rollup technology. It addresses Ethereum's scalability challenges by processing transactions off the mainnet."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Arbitrum employs Optimistic Rollups to batch transactions together, lowering gas fees and computational demands. These rollups presume transactions are valid unless evidence is presented to the contrary."

      "name": "How are validators incentivized in the Arbitrum ecosystem?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Validators are rewarded through transaction fees, incentive schemes for high performance and uptime, and staking rewards that require validators to stake tokens for accountability and earn rewards for honest participation."

      "name": "What are the economic considerations of validator rewards?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The design of validator reward systems aims to cover operational costs while preventing excessive token supply. It requires balancing incentives to ensure both validator participation and long-term network sustainability."

      "name": "What factors influence validator rewards?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Validator rewards are influenced by network demand, the number of active validators, and technological advances that might enhance network efficiency and adjust necessary reward levels."

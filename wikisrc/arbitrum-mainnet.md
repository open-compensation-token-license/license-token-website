# Arbitrum Mainnet: A Leap Forward in Ethereum Scalability

Blockchain technology has transformed various industries by offering decentralized, secure, and transparent systems. However, as blockchain adoption continues to rise, the limitations of scalability, cost, and transaction speed have become evident, particularly on the Ethereum network. Ethereum, the world’s most popular smart contract platform, has faced congestion and high gas fees. Enter [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io/), a Layer 2 scaling solution designed to enhance the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Introduction to Arbitrum

Arbitrum is a Layer 2 scaling solution developed by Offchain Labs focused on improving Ethereum's efficiency and user experience. By leveraging off-chain computation and optimized on-chain verification, Arbitrum helps reduce Ethereum’s scalability challenges, enabling faster and cheaper transactions while maintaining security and decentralization.

The Arbitrum mainnet, launched in August 2021, is designed to handle thousands of transactions per second (TPS) and reduce gas fees, reshaping how developers and users interact with the Ethereum blockchain.

## The Challenges of Ethereum Scalability

Ethereum’s architecture uses a Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanism but suffers from scalability constraints, processing around 15 transactions per second, leading to congestion and high gas fees during peak periods. Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum enhance the network’s capacity without altering its core architecture.

## How Arbitrum Works

Arbitrum operates as a Layer 2 rollup solution, bundling multiple transactions into single batches recorded on the Ethereum mainnet:

- **Off-Chain Computation:** Processes most transactions off-chain, reducing mainnet load and improving throughput.
- **Optimistic Rollups:** Assumes transactions are valid by default, with validators submitting fraud proofs when needed.
- **Secure and Trustless Design:** Ensures security with incentives and fraud proofs, preserving Ethereum’s decentralized nature.
- **Compatibility with Ethereum:** Compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), allowing seamless dApp deployment without rewriting smart contracts.

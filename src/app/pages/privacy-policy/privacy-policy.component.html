  <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>Personal data (usually referred to just as „data“ below) will only be processed by us to the extent necessary and for the purpose of providing a functional
    and user-friendly website, including its contents, and the services offered there.</p>
  <p>Per Art. 4 No. 1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, i.e. the General Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter referred to as the „GDPR“), „processing“ refers to
    any operation or set of operations such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation, alteration, retrieval, consultation, use,
    disclosure by transmission, dissemination, or otherwise making available, alignment, or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction performed on
    personal data, whether by automated means or not.</p>
  <p>The following privacy policy is intended to inform you in particular about the type, scope, purpose, duration, and legal basis for the processing of such
    data either under our own control or in conjunction with others. We also inform you below about the third-party components we use to optimize our website
    and improve the user experience which may result in said third parties also processing data they collect and control.</p>
  <p>Our privacy policy is structured as follows:</p>
  <p>I. Information about us as controllers of your data<br>II. The rights of users and data subjects<br>III. Information about the data processing</p>
  <h3>I. Information about us as controllers of your data</h3>
  <p>The party responsible for this website (the „controller“) for purposes of data protection law is:</p> iunera GmbH & Co. KG. <br> Altrottstraße 31,
  69190<br> Walldorf – Germany <p>Telefon: +49 6227 381350<br>E-Mail: datenschutz&#64;iunera.com </p>
  <h3>II. The rights of users and data subjects</h3>
  <p>With regard to the data processing to be described in more detail below, users and data subjects have the right</p>
  <ul>
    <li>to confirmation of whether data concerning them is being processed, information about the data being processed, further information about the nature of
      the data processing, and copies of the data (cf. also Art. 15 GDPR);
    </li>
    <li>to correct or complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art. 16 GDPR);</li>
    <li>to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art. 17 DSGVO), or, alternatively, if further processing is necessary as stipulated in Art.
      17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said processing per Art. 18 GDPR;
    </li>
    <li>to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by them and to have the same transmitted to other providers/controllers (cf. also Art. 20
      GDPR);
    </li>
    <li>to file complaints with the supervisory authority if they believe that data concerning them is being processed by the controller in breach of data
      protection provisions (see also Art. 77 GDPR).
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to whom it discloses data of any such corrections, deletions, or restrictions placed on
    processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1, 18 GDPR. However, this obligation does not apply if such notification is impossible or involves a
    disproportionate effort. Nevertheless, users have a right to information about these recipients.</p>
  <p><strong>Likewise, under Art. 21 GDPR, users and data subjects have the right to object to the controller’s future processing of their data pursuant to Art.
    6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. In particular, an objection to data processing for the purpose of direct advertising is permissible.</strong></p>
  <h3>III. Information about the data processing</h3>
  <p>Your data processed when using our website will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose for its storage ceases to apply, provided the deletion of the
    same is not in breach of any statutory storage obligations or unless otherwise stipulated below.</p> <h4 class="jet-listing-dynamic-field__content">
  Follow-up comments</h4>
  <p>If you make posts on our website, we also offer you the opportunity to subscribe to any subsequent follow-up comments made by third parties. In order to be
    able to inform you about these follow-up comments, we will need to process your email address.</p>
  <p>The legal basis for this is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a) GDPR. You may revoke your prior consent to this subscription under Art. 7 Para. 3 GDPR with future
    effect. All you have to do is inform us that you are revoking your consent or click on the unsubscribe link contained in each email.</p> <h4
  class="jet-listing-dynamic-field__content">Cookie Manager </h4>
  <p>To obtain consent for the use of technically unnecessary cookies on the website, the provider uses a cookie manager.</p>
  <p>When the website is called up, a cookie with the settings information is stored on the end device of the user so that the request for consent does not have
    to be made on a subsequent visit.</p>
  <p>The cookie is required to obtain legally compliant user consent.</p>
  <p>You can prevent cookies from being installed by adjusting the settings on your internet browser.</p> <h4 class="jet-listing-dynamic-field__content">
  Cookies</h4><h5>a) Session cookies</h5>
  <p>We use cookies on our website. Cookies are small text files or other storage technologies stored on your computer by your browser. These cookies process
    certain specific information about you, such as your browser, location data, or IP address.</p>
  <p>This processing makes our website more user-friendly, efficient, and secure, allowing us, for example, to display our website in different languages or to
    offer a shopping cart function.</p>
  <p>The legal basis for such processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR, insofar as these cookies are used to collect data to initiate or process contractual
    relationships.</p>
  <p>If the processing does not serve to initiate or process a contract, our legitimate interest lies in improving the functionality of our website. The legal
    basis is then Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR.</p>
  <p>When you close your browser, these session cookies are deleted.</p> <h5>b) Third-party cookies</h5>
  <p>If necessary, our website may also use cookies from companies with whom we cooperate for the purpose of advertising, analyzing, or improving the features
    of our website.</p>
  <p>Please refer to the following information for details, in particular for the legal basis and purpose of such third-party collection and processing of data
    collected through cookies.</p> <h5>c) Disabling cookies</h5>
  <p>You can refuse the use of cookies by changing the settings on your browser. Likewise, you can use the browser to delete cookies that have already been
    stored. However, the steps and measures required vary, depending on the browser you use. If you have any questions, please use the help function or consult
    the documentation for your browser or contact its maker for support. Browser settings cannot prevent so-called flash cookies from being set. Instead, you
    will need to change the setting of your Flash player. The steps and measures required for this also depend on the Flash player you are using. If you have
    any questions, please use the help function or consult the documentation for your Flash player or contact its maker for support.</p>
  <p>If you prevent or restrict the installation of cookies, not all of the functions on our site may be fully usable.</p> <h4

    be sent to us. We also store the IP address of your computer and the date and time of your registration. During the registration process, we will obtain
    your consent to receive this newsletter and the type of content it will offer, with reference made to this privacy policy. The data collected will be used
    exclusively to send the newsletter and will not be passed on to third parties.</p>
  <p>The legal basis for this is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a) GDPR.</p>
  <p>You may revoke your prior consent to receive this newsletter under Art. 7 Para. 3 GDPR with future effect. All you have to do is inform us that you are
    revoking your consent or click on the unsubscribe link contained in each newsletter.</p> <h4 class="jet-listing-dynamic-field__content">Server data</h4>
  <p>For technical reasons, the following data sent by your internet browser to us or to our server provider will be collected, especially to ensure a secure
    and stable website: These server log files record the type and version of your browser, operating system, the website from which you came (referrer URL),
    the webpages on our site visited, the date and time of your visit, as well as the IP address from which you visited our site.</p>
  <p>The data thus collected will be temporarily stored, but not in association with any other of your data.</p>
  <p>The basis for this storage is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the improvement, stability, functionality, and security of our
    website.</p>
  <p>The data will be deleted within no more than seven days, unless continued storage is required for evidentiary purposes. In which case, all or part of the
    data will be excluded from deletion until the investigation of the relevant incident is finally resolved.</p> <h4

  <p>General linking to third-party profiles</p>
  <p>The provider includes a link on the website to the social media listed below.</p>
  <p>The legal basis for this is Article 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The legitimate interest of the provider is to improve the quality of use of the website.</p>
  <p>The plugins are integrated via a linked graphic. The user is only forwarded to the service of the respective social media by clicking on the corresponding
    graphic.</p>
  <p>After the customer has been forwarded, information about the user is recorded by the respective social media. This is initially data such as IP address,
    date, time and page visited. If the user is logged into his/her user account of the respective social media at the same time, the social media operator can,
    if required, assign the information collected from the user’s specific visit to the user’s personal account. If the user interacts via a “Share” button of
    the respective social media, this information can be stored in the user’s personal user account and, if required, be published. If the user wants to prevent
    the collected information from being directly assigned to his/her user account, the user must log out before clicking on the graphic. It is also possible to
    configure the respective user account accordingly.</p>

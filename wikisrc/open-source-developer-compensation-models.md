To address this, various compensation models have emerged, enabling developers to earn a livelihood while contributing to the community. This article explores several prevalent compensation models for open source developers.

One of the most straightforward methods for compensating open source developers is through sponsorships and donations. Platforms like [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors) and [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/) allow individuals and organizations to financially support developers directly. This model relies heavily on community goodwill and the perceived value of the project.

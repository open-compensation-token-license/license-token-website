# Safeguarding Digital Assets: Navigating NFT Security

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have revolutionized digital ownership, offering unprecedented opportunities for creators and collectors. However, with these advancements come significant security challenges. This article delves into NFT security, highlighting the risks, vulnerabilities, and best practices necessary to protect digital assets in this expanding digital economy.

## Key Security Risks Associated with NFTs

1. **Phishing Attacks:** Cybercriminals use phishing to harvest private keys and credentials, leading to unauthorized NFT transfers.  
2. **Smart Contract Vulnerabilities:** Flaws in [smart contracts](https://www.license-token.com/wiki/smart-contracts-on-blockchain) can be exploited to manipulate NFTs.  
3. **Marketplace Fraud:** Unscrupulous actors may sell counterfeit or misrepresented NFTs without creator consent.  
4. **Wallet Security:** Digital wallets are vulnerable to hacks, risking the loss of NFTs. Learn more about [NFT wallets](https://www.license-token.com/wiki/what-is-an-nft-wallet).  
5. **Blockchain Network Vulnerabilities:** Network attacks could compromise the integrity of NFT-hosting blockchains. Explore [blockchain security](https://www.license-token.com/wiki/blockchain-security) for more insights.

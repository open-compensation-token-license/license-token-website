        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "NFTs, or Non-Fungible Tokens, are unique digital assets representing ownership of specific digital items such as art, music, or virtual real estate. Unlike fungible cryptocurrencies, each NFT is distinct and resides on blockchain platforms like Ethereum. They are significant because they transform digital ownership and authenticity, though they do not necessarily convey the copyright over the represented asset."

Contributors often work voluntarily, dedicating time to maintaining and improving projects. Without funding, they risk burnout or having to abandon projects, leading to vulnerabilities and diminished growth. Financial support allows contributors to focus on their work and ensures that the projects remain reliable and innovative."

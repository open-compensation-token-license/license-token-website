## Introduction

The **CryptoPunks NFT collection from Larva Labs** stands as a seminal milestone in the evolution of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and digital art. Launched in 2017, CryptoPunks pioneered the NFT space, introducing a unique blend of algorithmically generated 24x24 pixel art characters that have captured the imagination of collectors, artists, and enthusiasts worldwide. As the earliest iconic NFT collection, CryptoPunks not only set the standard for digital collectibles but also played a pivotal role in defining blockchain-based art ownership.

## History and Background

Developed by [Larva Labs](https://larvalabs.com/), a studio founded by Matt Hall and John Watkinson, the CryptoPunks project emerged from a simple yet ambitious vision: to create a collection of 10,000 unique, algorithmically generated characters that could be truly owned and traded on the blockchain. Drawing inspiration from the punk aesthetic, the developers infused each character with distinct traits, ensuring that no two CryptoPunks are identical.

The project debuted in June 2017 on the Ethereum blockchain, utilizing CryptoKitties' ERC-721 standard to represent ownership. At the time, NFTs were a nascent concept, and CryptoPunks quickly garnered attention for their innovative approach to digital art and collectibles. Over the years, CryptoPunks have appreciated exponentially in value, becoming a symbol of digital ownership and blockchain culture.

## Special Features

### Unique Pixel Art

Each CryptoPunk is a 24x24 pixel art character, meticulously crafted to embody a diverse range of appearances and rarities. The collection includes various types such as humans, zombies, aliens, and more, each with unique accessories and attributes. This diversity not only enhances the aesthetic appeal but also contributes to the scarcity and desirability of specific CryptoPunks.

### Limited Supply

The fixed supply of 10,000 CryptoPunks ensures exclusivity, a fundamental principle underpinning the NFT market. This scarcity drives demand, making each CryptoPunk a sought-after asset in digital art and collectibles markets.

### Provenance and Authenticity

Being one of the first NFT projects, CryptoPunks benefits from a well-established provenance. Each token on the Ethereum blockchain unequivocally verifies ownership and authenticity, eliminating concerns related to forgery or duplication common in traditional art markets.

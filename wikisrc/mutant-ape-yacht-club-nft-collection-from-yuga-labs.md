## Overview of Mutant Ape Yacht Club

The **Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC)** was unveiled in August 2021 as a complementary collection to BAYC. Comprising 20,000 mutant apes, the collection was divided into two primary categories:

1. **Mutant Apes**: Created through a "Mutant Serum," which holders of BAYC NFTs could use to mutate their existing apes into mutant variants.
2. **Freezer Apes**: A separate subset that was airdropped to BAYC holders, expanding the overall collection and offering additional ownership opportunities.

MAYC serves to democratize the ownership experience, allowing more community members to participate without the necessity of purchasing expensive BAYC NFTs.

## Features and Attributes

### Unique Traits

Each mutant ape in the MAYC collection boasts distinctive traits that contribute to their rarity and value. Traits include various fur colors, facial expressions, clothing, and accessories. The diversity in attributes ensures that no two mutant apes are identical, fostering a sense of uniqueness and exclusivity.

### Artistic Design

The artistic design of MAYC maintains the high standards set by BAYC, featuring vibrant colors and creative expressions. The mutants often exhibit exaggerated features and themes, reflecting a blend of contemporary art and pop culture influences.

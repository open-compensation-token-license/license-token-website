      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Layer 2 solutions are technologies that move transaction processing away from the main blockchain, thus increasing throughput. These include sidechains, state channels, and rollups, each with their own benefits and trade-offs."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Arbitrum improves transaction processing through transaction bundling, using a fraud proof mechanism, and implementing optimistic rollups. It makes transactions faster by assuming their correctness and slowing down only to address disputes."

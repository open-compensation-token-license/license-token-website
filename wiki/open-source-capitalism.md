# Exploring Open Source Capitalism: A Deep Dive into the Intersection of Innovation and Economics

Working draft of thoughts about open source capitalisam and exploitation.

Sum up:

**Open Source** can be considered [capitalist in general](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software#Economic_aspects).

Likely, we need to (re)consider what "open" and exploitation means and what the goal of free was.  

Let me explain why:

## **Defining Open Source Capitalism**

**Open Source Capitalism** is an economic and philosophical approach where the principles of [open source software development](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source) intersect with capitalist methodologies. It involves using open source resources to drive business value, innovation, and competition while still adhering to the open source ethos of accessibility and collaboration. Here, capitalism is not just about profit from software but creating economic models around open source that benefit both developers and businesses:

- **Core Concept:** It involves leveraging open source software for commercial gain through services, proprietary extensions, or innovative [licensing models](https://opensource.org/licenses) that still allow for some degree of openness.

- **Incentive Structures:** Unlike traditional capitalism where profit is the primary motivator, here, it might also include recognition, community status, or shared economic benefits.

## **Understanding Open Source Capitalism**

In the realm of software development, **Open Source Software** was traditionally viewed through a socialist lens with the advent of the [GNU General Public License (GPL)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), which prioritizes communal sharing and the collective good of code. However, the landscape has undergone a profound transformation with licenses like [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), [Apache](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), which have not only broadened but also commercialized the scope of open source, giving rise to what can be termed **Open Source Capitalism**.

## **Exploitation in Open Source**
The longest enduring model of [open source capitalism](https://github.com/open-compensation-token-license/octl/blob/main/octl-whitepaper.md#introduction) has been leveraging donations to support development. 

There's a stark disparity between the massive cost savings realized by using open source software (estimated at $9 trillion) and the relatively modest donation costs ($1.7 billion), resulting in a capitalist open source return on investment factor of 5,294 times. 

This economic model shows how open source can be both a source of innovation and a significant economic advantage. We do not think an open source return on investment factor of 5,294 times is anywhere near socialism. In the music industry, nobody thinks about socialism or capitalism, and it is widely accepted that artists should have a right to royalties. With the 5,294 times profit in the open source industry, one can argue that open source developers should be in the same position as musicians, being granted similar copyrights [as discussed in this whitepaper](https://github.com/open-compensation-token-license/octl/blob/main/octl-whitepaper.md).

## **The Economics of Open Source:**

- **Cost Savings vs. Donations:** The economic benefit of open source to companies is clear, but the compensation for developers remains disproportionately low [source](https://opensourcefundingsurvey2024.com/).

- **New Licensing Models:** Licenses like the [Open Compensation Token License](http://license-token.com) aim to address this by allowing developers to earn from their contributions, similar to how musicians earn royalties.

## **Defining Open Source in a Capitalist Context:**

Open Source foundations define software as 'open source' when it can be exploited for free, both commercially and non-commercially [source](https://opensource.org/osd). New interpretations within **open source capitalism** have scaled this concept into several layers:

1. **Core Code Visibility** - Only the core code is accessible, emphasizing transparency but limiting full access [what is often done with traditional dual-licensing](https://blog.opentap.io/dual-licensing-open-source-software).

2. **Complete Code Access** - The entire codebase is available for viewing, a practice often referred to as [source-available software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-available_software).

3. **Free to Modify and Extend** - Users can change or extend the code without cost, embodying the spirit of open source with licenses like the [Open Compensation Token License](https://github.com/open-compensation-token-license/octl).

4. **Commercial Use for Free** - Permitting commercial exploitation without fee, which is a core tenet of [Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software).

The **Fair Code principles** further ensure that software remains open when available, even if not free, [aiming for a balance between commercial interests and community benefits](https://faircode.io/#principles).

## **New Licenses Reflecting Capitalist Principles:**

- **Open Compensation Token License (OCTL):** This license introduces a novel approach by allowing parts of the code to be sold, with licensing required for commercial use where royalties are redistributed to the code's owners. [This model incentivizes contribution through financial reward, pushing towards a more direct form of **open source capitalism**](https://github.com/open-compensation-token-license/license). This has been further explored in discussions on new economic models for open source [source](https://blog.openchain.org/2023/05/02/exploring-new-licensing-models-in-open-source/).

- **Server Side Public License (SSPL):** Ensures that any server software using the code must share its source code publicly. For commercial use, companies are required to contribute back any changes or improvements, [aiming to prevent large corporations from monopolizing community-developed software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Side_Public_License). [The community has debated the implications of SSPL extensively](https://opensource.com/article/20/7/sspl).

- **Business Source License (BSL):** [Allows companies to share software with commercial use restrictions](https://www.hashicorp.com/bsl), which then transition to open-source after a set period (often four years). This license provides a temporary monopoly, fostering initial commercial exclusivity while ensuring eventual open access, [with the licensor having the ability to modify terms ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Source_License). [The transition from BSL has been a point of discussion in the tech community](https://blog.hashicorp.com/why-we-re-adopting-the-business-source-license).

## **Socialism vs. Capitalism in the Open Source Context:**

- **Socialism in Open Source:** This aligns with the ethos of collective ownership where software like [Linux](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) or [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) thrives on community contributions, aimed at communal benefit rather than individual profit. 

- **Capitalism in Open Source:** Here, the emphasis is on leveraging open source for innovation, competition, and profit. Capitalism in open source involves creating economic value through services, proprietary extensions, or through licensing models like BSL or OCTL, where initial commercial exclusivity can lead to significant revenue before transitioning to open source.

These systems reflect broader societal debates:

- **Innovation vs. Accessibility:** Capitalism drives innovation through competition but might limit access for profit. Socialism ensures accessibility but can face challenges in incentivizing continuous development without capitalist incentives.

- **Sustainability:** Capitalism offers financial models to keep large projects sustainable, while socialism relies on community goodwill, potentially struggling with funding without external support or alternative models.

- **Power Dynamics:** In capitalism, there's a risk of large entities dominating open source ecosystems, whereas socialism aims to maintain power with the community.

## **Further thoughts for feedback**

- Are these new licenses more reflective of **open source capitalism** than the traditional donation-based model?

- Which license best embodies the spirit of **open source capitalism**, or what criteria should we use to judge the balance between exploiting capitalism and fostering innovation?

- Can **Open Source Capitalism** truly balance the open source ideals of freedom and collaboration with the profit motives of capitalism, or does one inevitably compromise the other?

## **FAQ**

- **What is Open Source Capitalism?**

On example how Open Source capitalism can be implemented is the fair code approach with liences like the Open Token Compensation License.

- **How does Open Source Capitalism differ from traditional capitalism?**  
  It focuses on using open source as a means for business innovation and profit, often through services or proprietary extensions, rather than solely on selling the software itself.

- **Can open source developers receive royalties similar to musicians?**  
  With licenses like the [Open Compensation Token License](http://license-token.com), developers can potentially earn royalties from their code contributions, mirroring the royalty system in music.

- **What are the main criticisms of Open Source Capitalism?**  
  Criticisms include the potential for large companies to exploit open source for profit without adequate compensation to developers, and the risk of diminishing the communal ethos of open source.

- **How does the Business Source License work?**  
  The [Business Source License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Source_License) allows software to be initially proprietary but automatically transitions to open source after a set period, balancing business interests with community benefits.

# Exploring the Intersection of NFTs and Digital Rights Management

The digital landscape is rapidly evolving, largely driven by innovations like blockchain technology, which have introduced new paradigms of digital ownership through Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). These advancements challenge and potentially transform traditional notions of Digital Rights Management (DRM). Understanding how NFTs and DRM collaborate or collide is crucial for stakeholders in creative industries and legal systems.

## NFT and DRM Convergence

Both NFTs and DRM offer groundbreaking approaches to addressing digital rights and ownership. As NFTs establish provenance and ownership in the digital space, they provide artists and creators mechanisms to control and track their digital content effectively. Smart contracts can automate royalty distributions, allowing creators to maintain rights over secondary sales.

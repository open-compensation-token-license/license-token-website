# The History of NFTs: A Digital Revolution

The rise of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) marks a significant shift in the digital world, intertwining art, technology, and economics in unprecedented ways. To better understand this phenomenon, we can explore the foundational aspects and the evolution that has led to the current booming NFT landscape.

### 1. Genesis of Blockchain and Cryptocurrency: Laying the Groundwork

The [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) technology, the cornerstone of NFTs, was initially conceptualized in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta as a method for timestamping digital documents. However, the advent of Bitcoin in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto was a major milestone that brought blockchain technology and cryptocurrency to the forefront of innovation and public interest.

### 2. From Cryptocurrency to Tokens: The Birth of Ethereum

Ethereum, introduced by Vitalik Buterin in 2013, expanded the utility of blockchain technology. Known primarily for its smart contracts, Ethereum facilitated the creation of token standards like [ERC-20 and ERC-721](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/), which are pivotal to the development and exchange of NFTs.

NFT history traces back to 2014 with projects like “Colored Coins” and subsequently with [CryptoPunks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks) and [CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/), which were among the first to showcase the potential of digital ownership, capturing public curiosity and involvement.

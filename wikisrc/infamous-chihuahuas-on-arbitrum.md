[Arbitrum](https://www.arbitrum.io), a Layer 2 scaling solution designed for Ethereum, enhances this experience by offering faster and cheaper transactions. It offloads computing work from Ethereum, significantly reducing costs and increasing transaction speeds, making it a favored platform for NFT trading.

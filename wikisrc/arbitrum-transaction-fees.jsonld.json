      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Arbitrum is a Layer 2 scaling solution designed to improve the transaction throughput and reduce the costs on the Ethereum network. It enhances Ethereum's efficiency by processing a large number of transactions off-chain and then recording them on the Ethereum blockchain, thereby reducing congestion and high gas fees."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Optimism, like Arbitrum, is a Layer 2 scaling solution aimed at improving Ethereum's scalability. While both focus on reducing congestion and fees, they differ in their technical implementations. Optimism uses an approach known as Optimistic Rollups, while Arbitrum applies its own unique mechanisms for achieving similar goals. Both solutions contribute significantly to enhancing Ethereum's scalability."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Polygon (previously known as Matic Network) offers a framework for building and connecting multiple blockchain networks, each providing a different scaling solution. It aims to transform Ethereum into a multi-chain ecosystem akin to that of Polkadot and Cosmos, further promoting scalability and better user experience."

      "name": "What is the difference between zk-Rollups and Optimistic Rollups?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "zk-Rollups and Optimistic Rollups are both Layer 2 scaling solutions but differ primarily in their fraud-proof mechanisms. zk-Rollups use zero-knowledge proofs to bundle multiple transactions off-chain and verify them quickly, providing immediate finality. Optimistic Rollups assume transactions are valid by default and only perform computationally expensive fraud proofs when a challenge is raised."

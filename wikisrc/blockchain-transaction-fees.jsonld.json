      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Transaction fee structures vary significantly. Bitcoin fees depend on transaction size and network congestion. Ethereum uses a gas system, with fees adjusting dynamically thanks to the EIP-1559 update. Other networks like Cardano, Solana, and Binance Smart Chain have their unique fee mechanisms aligning with their consensus algorithms and architectures."

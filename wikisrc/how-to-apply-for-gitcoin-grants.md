## Understanding Gitcoin Grants

Before applying, it is crucial to understand the philosophy and functioning of Gitcoin Grants. Gitcoin is a community-driven platform that matches funding from multiple sources to open-source projects. Their mission is to grow open source and connect developers with the funding they need. Gitcoin Grants operates using quadratic funding, which prioritizes the number of contributors over the size of individual contributions, allowing smaller projects with large community support to thrive.

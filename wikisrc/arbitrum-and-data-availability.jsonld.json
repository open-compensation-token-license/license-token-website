        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Layer-2 solutions are technologies built on top of existing blockchains to improve scalability and efficiency. They process transactions outside of the main chain, reducing congestion and gas fees. Arbitrum, for example, uses Optimistic Rollup to batch transactions off-chain, increasing throughput and lowering costs."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Arbitrum features the Optimistic Rollup Protocol, a fraud proof system, smart contract compatibility with Ethereum's EVM, and cost efficiency by offloading transactions from the main chain."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Data availability ensures that users can independently access the data necessary to validate transactions, which is crucial for security, facilitating verification, and boosting user participation by ensuring trust and encouraging network engagement."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "To address data availability challenges, solutions include storing rollup metadata on the Layer 1 chain, using Data Availability Committees (DACs), and implementing Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to verify transactions without exposing details."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Arbitrum's framework addresses Ethereum's scalability and data availability challenges, crucial for the growth of decentralized finance and applications. By ensuring effective data management, Arbitrum aligns with the core values of blockchain, fostering a more scalable, secure, and trustworthy decentralized ecosystem."

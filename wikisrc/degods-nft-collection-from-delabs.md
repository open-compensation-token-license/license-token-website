The unique traits and attributes of each DEGOd contribute to its rarity and desirability in the NFT marketplace.

### Blockchain Technology

DEGOdS NFTs are minted on the [Ethereum blockchain](https://ethereum.org), benefiting from its robust infrastructure and widespread adoption. Ethereum's smart contract capabilities ensure that each DEGOd is securely stored and easily transferable. This decentralized approach provides transparency and immutability, key factors that enhance the trust and value of the collection.

By providing tangible value, DEGOdS enhances the overall experience for collectors and incentivizes long-term investment.

## How to Acquire DEGOdS NFTs

### Minting Process

Acquiring a DEGOd begins with the minting process, where new NFTs are created and made available for purchase. Minting typically occurs through the DEGOdS official platform or partnering NFT marketplaces. Interested buyers must connect their cryptocurrency wallets, such as [MetaMask](https://metamask.io), and follow the minting instructions provided.

It's essential to participate early, as minting events often sell out quickly due to high demand. Stay updated with Delabs' announcements on their [Twitter](https://twitter.com/delabs) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/delabs) to ensure you don't miss out on upcoming minting opportunities.

### Secondary Marketplaces

After minting, DEGOdS NFTs can be bought, sold, or traded on various secondary marketplaces. Platforms like [OpenSea](https://opensea.io) and [Rarible](https://rarible.com) provide auction and fixed-price sale options, allowing collectors to find DEGOdS NFTs that fit their preferences and budget. The liquidity and visibility offered by these marketplaces contribute to the dynamic pricing and broad accessibility of DEGOdS.

# Fair Source Software

Fair Source Software is an emerging licensing model that seeks to bridge the gap between open-source and proprietary software by offering a balanced approach to software distribution and usage rights. It aims to provide developers with a sustainable business model while granting users access to software under specific conditions. This article delves into the definition, characteristics, benefits, and criticisms of fair source software, comparing it with traditional open-source and proprietary models.

## Introduction

In the evolving landscape of software development, licensing models play a pivotal role in determining how software can be used, modified, and distributed. Traditional **open-source licenses** offer broad freedoms to users but often lack straightforward commercial monetization strategies. On the other hand, **proprietary licenses** provide clear commercial frameworks but restrict user freedoms. **Fair source software** emerges as a hybrid approach, attempting to balance these dichotomies by offering open access under certain conditions while preserving commercial interests.

## History and Definition

### Origins of Fair Source Software

The concept of fair source software gained traction in response to the growing challenges faced by developers in monetizing open-source projects. As more businesses and individuals embrace open-source solutions, sustaining these projects financially becomes increasingly difficult. Fair source software aims to address this by introducing licensing terms that allow for free use under specific conditions, typically limiting commercial exploitation without appropriate compensation.

### Defining Fair Source Software

Fair source software is generally defined as software that is available to users under a license that permits free use, modification, and distribution for non-commercial purposes. Commercial use, however, requires obtaining a separate license or permission, often involving financial remuneration to the original developers. This model seeks to provide transparency and fairness in how software is accessed and utilized, ensuring that creators are compensated for commercial benefits derived from their work.

## Key Characteristics

### Source Availability

Like open-source software, fair source software provides access to the source code, allowing users to inspect, modify, and enhance the software. This transparency encourages community collaboration and innovation while maintaining certain restrictions on commercial usage.

### Licensing Terms

Fair source licenses typically include clear clauses that differentiate between non-commercial and commercial usage. These terms explicitly state the conditions under which the software can be used freely and outline the requirements for commercial entities seeking to leverage the software for profit.

### Sustainability for Developers

By allowing commercial licensing, fair source software offers developers a viable path to monetize their work. This sustainability is crucial for ensuring long-term maintenance, updates, and support for the software, addressing a common limitation of many open-source projects.

| **Commercial Use**       | Generally allowed under specific licenses (e.g., MIT)    | Requires separate licensing or permission                 | Allowed with restrictions based on the license terms      |
| **Modification Rights**  | Yes                                                       | Yes                                                        | Limited to none or specific allowances                    |
| **Distribution Rights**  | Yes                                                       | Yes                                                        | Restricted based on license agreements                    |
| **Monetization**         | Indirect (donations, support services)                    | Direct (commercial licenses)                               | Direct (sales, subscriptions)                             |

Fair source software occupies a middle ground, combining the collaborative benefits of open source with the monetization potential of proprietary models. This balance aims to cater to both individual users and commercial entities, fostering a more inclusive ecosystem.

## Benefits of Fair Source Software

### Enhanced Developer Revenue

By permitting commercial use under specific licensing terms, fair source software enables developers to generate revenue directly from their creations. This financial incentive is crucial for attracting talent and ensuring the continuous improvement of the software.

### Community Collaboration

Despite the commercial restrictions, the availability of source code fosters community collaboration. Developers and users can contribute to the project, identify bugs, and implement new features, driving innovation and enhancing software quality.

### Clear Usage Guidelines

Fair source licenses provide explicit guidelines on how the software can be used, reducing legal ambiguities. Users and businesses are clearly informed about their rights and obligations, fostering trust and reducing potential conflicts.

### Flexibility for Users

Users benefit from the ability to utilize the software for personal or non-commercial purposes without financial barriers. This accessibility promotes widespread adoption and experimentation, further enriching the softwareâ€™s development.

## Criticisms and Limitations

### Perceived Restrictions

Some critics argue that fair source software imposes unnecessary restrictions compared to traditional open-source licenses. The requirement for separate commercial licensing can deter businesses from adopting the software, potentially limiting its reach and impact.

### Community Fragmentation

Introducing commercial licensing may lead to fragmentation within the user community. Tensions can arise between those advocating for open access and those supporting the monetization aspects, potentially hindering collaborative efforts.

While fair source aims to provide a sustainable model, its success largely depends on the willingness of commercial entities to pay for licenses. In scenarios where this willingness is low, developers may struggle to achieve financial sustainability.

## Notable Examples

### MongoDB

MongoDB initially operated under the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL), a strong copyleft license. However, to address commercial challenges, they introduced the Server Side Public License (SSPL), which can be seen as a move towards a fair source model by requiring commercial users to open their own service source code.

### Redis Labs

Redis Labs offers Redis under the Redis Source Available License (RSAL). This license allows users to access and modify the source code for personal and non-commercial use while requiring a commercial license for production environments, aligning with the fair source principles.

### Cockroach Labs

CockroachDB provides its software under the Business Source License (BSL), allowing free use for non-production purposes. Commercial deployments require a license, exemplifying the fair source approach by balancing accessibility with monetization.

## Summary

Fair source software represents a nuanced approach to software licensing, blending the openness of traditional open-source models with the commercial viability of proprietary licenses. By allowing free use for non-commercial purposes while providing avenues for monetization in commercial settings, it seeks to create a sustainable ecosystem for developers and a flexible framework for users.

This model addresses key challenges faced by open-source projects, particularly in monetization and long-term maintenance. However, it is not without its criticisms, including perceived restrictions and potential community fragmentation. Notable examples like MongoDB and Redis Labs demonstrate the practical application of fair source principles, highlighting both its potential and the complexities involved.

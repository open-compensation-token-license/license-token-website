        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology (DLT) that records transactions in a decentralized manner, eliminating the need for intermediaries. Transactions are recorded in 'blocks', which form a 'chain'. This structure, combined with cryptographic techniques, ensures data integrity and immutability. It is decentralized and public, promoting transparency."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Blockchain's transparency can compromise privacy. Pseudonymity offers an illusion of privacy but can be traced back to real identities. Data permanence contradicts privacy laws like the GDPR that require data alteration capabilities. Transparent data linkability may inadvertently expose personal information."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Privacy solutions for blockchain include Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), mixing services, ring signatures, confidential transactions, and decentralized identity solutions. Regulatory measures like GDPR compliance and standardization also provide frameworks for ensuring privacy."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "ZCash is a cryptocurrency that uses zero-knowledge proofs to enhance transaction privacy. It allows users to choose between transparent and shielded transactions, where addresses and transaction amounts can be hidden, offering flexibility in maintaining privacy."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "In healthcare, projects like MedRec use blockchain to securely manage electronic medical records. They enhance privacy by allowing patients to control access to their data through decentralized identity verification and access permissions while maintaining data integrity and availability."

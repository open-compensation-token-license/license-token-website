# Exploring GitHub Sponsors: Supporting Open Source Sustainably

[GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors) is an innovative program launched by GitHub in May 2019. Its primary aim is to support the open-source community by enabling developers and companies to financially back open-source projects and their maintainers. Below is a comprehensive overview of how GitHub Sponsors operates and its significance.

## Understanding GitHub Sponsors

### The Basics

GitHub Sponsors allows developers and organizations to sponsor other developers or projects on GitHub. It functions like platforms such as [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com), whereby sponsors commit to monthly payments supporting open-source contributors. For more insights on open-source sponsorship, you can explore [open-source sponsorship](https://www.license-token.com/wiki/open-source-sponsorship).

### Eligibility

Developers need to maintain at least one open-source project on GitHub and have a verified bank account in a supported region to receive payouts. GitHub is expanding its regional support to be more inclusive globally. You can check [what countries support GitHub Sponsors](https://www.license-token.com/wiki/what-countries-support-git-hub-sponsors) for more details.

Conversely, any GitHub account holder can sponsor a developer or project without needing their own project. 

## Mechanism and Features

1. **Developer Signup and Application**: Developers must apply to join the program, describing their contributions and explaining their open-source projects. Learn more about [how to become a sponsored developer](https://www.license-token.com/wiki/how-to-become-a-sponsored-developer).
2. **Profile and Tier Creation**: Approved developers set up a public sponsorship profile and multiple sponsorship tiers with varying rewards.

### Sponsorships

1. Sponsors find developers/projects through the platform, select a tier, and set up a monthly payment plan.
2. GitHub oversees and processes financial transactions, waiving personal fees for developers in the first year.

### Engagement and Recognition

1. Sponsors gain visibility on developers' profiles, promoting a sense of community.
2. Sponsors like companies can also contribute, reflecting their reliance on open-source tools.

## Impacts of GitHub Sponsors

GitHub Sponsors provides:

- **Financial Sustainability**: Ensures developers can continue their work without financial constraints. For more on sustainable funding, see [sustainable funding for open source](https://www.license-token.com/wiki/sustainable-funding-for-open-source).

- **Encouragement for New Developers**: Offers incentives encouraging participation in open-source projects.

However, consider challenges such as:

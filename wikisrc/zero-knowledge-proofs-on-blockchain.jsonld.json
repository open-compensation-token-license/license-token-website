        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Zero-knowledge proofs are cryptographic protocols that allow one party, the prover, to demonstrate to another party, the verifier, that a statement is true without revealing any additional information beyond the validity of the statement. They offer privacy while establishing trust."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Zero-knowledge proofs have three key properties: Completeness (if the statement is true, the verifier is convinced by the prover), Soundness (if the statement is false, no deceitful prover can convince the verifier), and Zero-Knowledge (the verifier gains no additional knowledge beyond the statement's truth)."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "In blockchain, zero-knowledge proofs enable private transactions by proving transaction validity without revealing transaction details. They also facilitate identity verification without disclosure of personal info, thus addressing privacy challenges while maintaining trust."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Key zero-knowledge proof technologies include zk-SNARKs (used for computationally efficient and non-interactive succinct proofs), zk-STARKs (focus on scalability and eliminating trusted setups), Bulletproofs (efficient for confidential transactions), and newer technologies like PLONK and Halo that enhance scalability and cross-platform compatibility."

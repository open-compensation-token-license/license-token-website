        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The blockchain scalability issue, often referred to as the 'trilemma,' involves balancing scalability, security, and decentralization. Networks like Ethereum face challenges in scaling, leading to higher transaction fees and congestion during peak periods."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Layer-2 solutions are protocols built on top of blockchain networks like Ethereum to enhance scalability. They process transactions off the main chain, reducing congestion and lowering costs, thereby increasing throughput."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Arbitrum is a layer-2 solution that uses optimistic rollups to increase Ethereum's transaction throughput. It batches transactions and assumes their validity unless disputed, processing them off-chain while securing them on Ethereum's mainnet. Arbitrum is compatible with Ethereum's existing infrastructure."

      "name": "What are sidechains, and how do they relate to Ethereum?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Sidechains are independent blockchains that operate parallel to main chains like Ethereum, providing their own consensus mechanisms. They allow assets to move seamlessly via a two-way peg, providing a flexible environment for customization and faster transactions."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What are the benefits and considerations of using sidechains?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The benefits of sidechains include autonomy, customizable environments, and increased transaction speed. Considerations include potentially lower security compared to the main chain and challenges in interoperability."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Even as Ethereum transitions to a proof-of-stake consensus with Ethereum 2.0, layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum and sidechains remain crucial. They provide additional scalability layers and enhance dApp development efficiency."

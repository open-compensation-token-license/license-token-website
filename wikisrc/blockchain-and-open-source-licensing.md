# Exploring the Symbiosis: Blockchain and Open Source Licensing

## Understanding Blockchain Technology

Blockchain is a decentralized, digital ledger designed to ensure data integrity and transparency. Key components include:

- **Blocks**: Immutable records of verified transactions.
- **Chains**: Sequentially connected blocks maintaining a continuous record.
- **Nodes**: Devices validating and relaying transactions.
- **Consensus Mechanisms**: Techniques like Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) to maintain ledger agreement.

## Exploring Open Source Licensing

Open source software allows public access to its code, promoting community collaboration and innovation. Types include:

- **Permissive Licenses**: Minimal restrictions, e.g., MIT, Apache.
- **Copyleft Licenses**: Share-alike terms, e.g., GNU GPL.
- **Other Licenses**: Balance freedom and protection, e.g., MPL, EPL.

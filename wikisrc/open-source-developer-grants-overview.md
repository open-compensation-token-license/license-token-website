# Open Source Developer Grants

**Open Source Developer Grants** are financial incentives provided to developers and contributors working on open source projects. These grants aim to help individuals or teams focus on their contributions by alleviating financial constraints. By doing so, they support innovation, maintain critical tools, and ensure the long-term sustainability of open source ecosystems.

## **What Are Open Source Developer Grants?**

Open source projects often rely on volunteer efforts, leaving many contributors without financial compensation. Grants specifically target this issue by funding developers to create deliverables, address project needs, or explore new technologies. Unlike sponsorships or donations, grants are often tied to specific goals, making them a structured and impactful form of support. For those interested in the challenges of unpaid contributions, see [unpaid volunteer work](https://www.license-token.com/wiki/unpaid-volunteer-work).

        "text": "Arbitrum is a Layer 2 solution that enhances Ethereum's scalability and efficiency by processing transactions off-chain before posting them on-chain.

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Developers should consider the project's goals and philosophy, the choice between permissive and copyleft licenses, compatibility with other licenses, community contributions, intellectual property protection, and legal considerations. Consulting with legal experts and leveraging resources like the Open Source Initiative can also be beneficial."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Permissive licenses, like MIT and Apache 2.0, allow users to freely use, modify, and distribute software with minimal restrictions and are suitable for commercial use. Copyleft licenses, like GPL, require any modified versions of the project to be released under the same license, promoting transparency and shared growth."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Ensuring license compatibility with other project dependencies prevents legal conflicts that can inhibit project development. Considering community contributions helps in attracting more contributors; permissive licenses often attract more contributors due to their flexibility."

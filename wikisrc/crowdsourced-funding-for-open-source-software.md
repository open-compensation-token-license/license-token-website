# Crowdsourced Funding for Open-Source Software (OSS)

Crowdsourced funding, or crowdfunding, is a method of raising financial support for projects by pooling small contributions from a large number of individuals, typically through online platforms. In the context of open-source software (OSS), it has emerged as a vital way for developers, maintainers, and contributors to sustain their projects financially. This approach is crucial for maintaining the [sustainability of open-source projects](https://www.license-token.com/wiki/sustainable-funding-open-source) and ensuring their continued development and growth.

## Why Crowdsourcing Was Needed for OSS?

Open-source software is inherently free to use, modify, and distribute, which often means developers are not directly compensated for their work. While small-scale projects may be sustained through passion and [unpaid volunteer work](https://www.license-token.com/wiki/unpaid-volunteer-work), larger or widely-used OSS projects demand considerable time and resources to maintain, update, and secure. Crowdsourced funding has proven to be a solution that bridges the financial gap, ensuring project longevity while maintaining independence from traditional funding avenues like corporate sponsorships. This independence is crucial to avoid conflicts of interest and maintain the community-driven nature of OSS.

## Crowdfunding Methods for OSS

There are multiple strategies for raising funds via crowdsourcing:

1. **Recurring Donations**: Platforms like [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/), [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors), and [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/) allow contributors to pledge regular donations, supporting developers on an ongoing basis.
2. **One-Time Contributions**: OSS developers can receive one-off financial support through payment services like [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/) or crypto donations.
3. **Dedicated Crowdfunding Campaigns**: Platforms such as [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/) and [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/) enable campaigns specifically for funding particular features, projects, or events.

These methods are part of broader [open-source project funding strategies](https://www.license-token.com/wiki/open-source-project-funding-strategies) that help maintain financial stability and project growth.

## Benefits of Crowdsourcing for OSS

1. **Sustainability**: Regular funding ensures that developers are compensated for their time and can focus on improving the project. This aligns with the principles of [software sustainability](https://www.license-token.com/wiki/software-sustainability).
2. **Community-Driven Development**: Crowdfunding empowers users to influence a project’s future, prioritizing features that supporters find valuable.
3. **Independence**: Unlike corporate sponsorship, crowdfunding allows OSS projects to remain community-oriented and avoid conflicts of interest.

## Challenges

- **Awareness and Motivation**: Convincing users to fund "free" software can be difficult. This challenge is often discussed in the context of [open-source monetization challenges and strategies](https://www.license-token.com/wiki/open-source-monetization-challenges-and-strategies).
- **Financial Instability**: Contributions may fluctuate, making it hard to plan long-term.
- **Lack of Transparency**: Supporters often expect updates on how their funds are used, which is why [financial transparency](https://www.license-token.com/wiki/open-source-project-financial-transparency) is crucial.

## Notable Examples

- **Vue.js**: Generates significant funds through GitHub Sponsors.
- **OpenSSL**: Raised over $300,000 after the Heartbleed vulnerability via crowdfunding.
- **Godot Engine**: Successfully funds many features via Patreon.

# License-Token: Empowering Open Source Creators

## Introduction

In the dynamic world of technology, open source initiatives remain central to fostering innovation, collaboration, and community engagement. However, open source creators frequently encounter challenges concerning licensing, attribution, and monetization. **License-Token** emerges as a cutting-edge solution to streamline licensing, ensure accurate attribution, and facilitate new monetization opportunities, enhancing the empowerment of open source creators.

## Understanding Open Source Licensing

Open source licenses define the use, modification, and distribution of software, ensuring the integrity and collaboration of open source projects. Despite the benefits of prominent licenses like the GNU General Public License (GPL), Apache License, and MIT License, complexities can pose challenges for creators and users alike.

### Common Challenges:
- **Complexity and Ambiguity**
- **Attribution Requirements**
- **Monetization**

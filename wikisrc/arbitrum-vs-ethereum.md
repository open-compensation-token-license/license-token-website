# Arbitrum vs Ethereum: A Comparative Analysis

In the landscape of blockchain technology, [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) has emerged as a foundational platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts. However, with its widespread usage come certain limitations, notably scalability issues and high gas fees. This has created opportunities for layer 2 solutions like [Arbitrum](https://offchainlabs.com/arbitrum/) to enhance Ethereum's transaction capacity and economic efficiency. This article delves into the differences and synergies between Ethereum and Arbitrum, examining their architectures, strengths, and implications for the future of blockchain technology.

## Key Differences and Interplay

- **Ethereum** operates as a layer 1 blockchain utilizing a proof-of-stake consensus, though it struggles with scalability and high fees during peak periods. For more details on blockchain types, see [types of blockchains](https://www.license-token.com/wiki/types-of-blockchains).
- **Arbitrum**, as a layer 2 solution, employs optimistic rollups to increase throughput and decrease fees by processing transactions off-chain before communicating with Ethereum's mainnet.

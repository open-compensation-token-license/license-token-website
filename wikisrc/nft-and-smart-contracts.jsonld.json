        "text": "NFTs, or Non-Fungible Tokens, are unique digital assets verified through blockchain technology, acting as certificates of authenticity. Each NFT represents ownership of a specific item or content, differentiating them from fungible cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. This allows NFTs to enable direct monetization for creators, as seen with the notable sale of Beepleâ€™s digital collage for $69 million in the art world."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Beyond digital art, NFTs have applications in music, gaming, and real estate. In music, they enable direct sales of content and concert experiences to fans. In gaming, NFTs represent in-game assets, allowing true ownership and trade within decentralized economies. For real estate, NFTs streamline transactions, reducing paperwork and intermediaries both in virtual and real-world settings."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Smart contracts are self-executing contracts coded within the blockchain, automating transactions when predetermined conditions are met. They enhance transparency and reduce costs, crucially underpinning the management of NFTs, including ownership and uniqueness. Smart contracts can also automate royalty payments, ensuring creators receive income as their work is transacted."

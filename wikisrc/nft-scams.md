### Navigating the Murky Waters of NFT Scams

In recent years, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have captivated the digital world, offering artists and collectors new opportunities. However, this burgeoning market has also become a hotbed for scams. Understanding NFT fraud and protecting oneself is crucial for anyone entering this digital space. Below, we explore common NFT scams and provide guidance on safe navigation.

### Understanding NFTs

NFTs are unique digital assets representing ownership of content or items on the blockchain. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, which are fungible, NFTs are unique and non-interchangeable. This makes them valuable in digital art, music, and gaming. For more on why NFTs are valuable, visit [Why Are NFTs Valuable](https://www.license-token.com/wiki/why-are-nf-ts-valuable).

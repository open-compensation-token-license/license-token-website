        "text": "Blockchain security is underpinned by several key principles: Decentralization, which reduces single points of failure; Cryptography, which safeguards data through techniques such as hash functions and digital signatures; Consensus Mechanisms, such as Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS), which validate transactions; and Immutability, which ensures the near impossibility of altering data once recorded, thereby strengthening trust."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Blockchain security faces several emerging threats, including: 51% Attacks, where majority mining control can manipulate transactions; Smart Contract Exploits, where bugs can lead to fund losses; Sybil Attacks, where fake identities are used to gain network control; Phishing and Social Engineering, which leverage human error; and Quantum Computing Threats, which may eventually break current cryptographic methods."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Mitigating blockchain security risks involves: deploying Improved Consensus Protocols such as PoS and BFT models; using Formal Verification to ensure smart contract correctness; adopting Layered Security Solutions, like sidechains; implementing Decentralized Identity and Access Management to reduce phishing; and developing Quantum-Resistant Algorithms to protect against future quantum attacks."

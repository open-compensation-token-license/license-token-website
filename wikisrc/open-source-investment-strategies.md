# Open Source Project Investment

**Open Source Project Investment** refers to the strategic allocation of resources—financial, human, or otherwise—into open-source software (OSS) projects for both altruistic and business-driven reasons. Open-source projects are built on publicly accessible codebases, enabling transparency, collaboration, and free redistribution. Investing in these projects benefits not only the investors but the larger developer community and ecosystems that utilize OSS.

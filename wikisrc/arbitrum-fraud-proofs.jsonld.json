        "@type": "Answer",

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Arbitrum fraud proofs involve a challenge/response protocol where off-chain transaction results can be challenged within a set period. Challengers provide evidence against incorrect results, and disputes are resolved on Layer 1 using a bisection protocol."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Fraud proofs provide correctness in a trustless system by resolving disputes on Layer 1 and imposing penalties on fraudulent behaviors, effectively deterring malicious actors and ensuring transaction integrity."

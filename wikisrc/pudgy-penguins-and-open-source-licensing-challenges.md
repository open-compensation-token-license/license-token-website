## Introduction

The digital landscape has witnessed myriad innovations, among which Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) stand tall. One NFT project, Pudgy Penguins, has become a significant presence. Yet, at the heart of this project lies a complex challenge: open source licensing. As more creators engage in decentralized economies, understanding open source licenses becomes crucial. This article explores the Pudgy Penguins project, the open source licensing challenges it faces, and broader implications for the NFT industry.

## The Open Source Licensing Landscape

As creativity flourishes within the Pudgy Penguins community, the project often builds on existing open source technologies. This can lead to legal and ethical challenges, given open source licenses specify usage and modification terms. Popular licenses include the [GNU General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), and [Apache License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0). Each offers different levels of freedom and obligation, impacting how users interact with the software.

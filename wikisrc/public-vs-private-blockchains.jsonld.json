        "text": "Blockchain technology is a type of distributed ledger technology (DLT) that records data in a series of blocks. These blocks are immutable, meaning they cannot be altered once added to the ledger. The system operates through a network of nodes that collectively verify transactions, providing security, transparency, and reducing dependency on intermediaries."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Public blockchains are open to anyone who wishes to participate. They are characterized by their transparency, decentralization, security, and the ability to promote innovation through open-source development. Examples include Bitcoin and Ethereum."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Public blockchains offer high transparency, decentralization reducing centralized failure and fraud risk, excellent security due to wide transaction validation participation, and a platform for open-source innovation."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Public blockchains often struggle with scalability due to global consensus requirements, have high energy consumption, especially with proof-of-work models, and pose privacy concerns since data is widely accessible."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Private blockchains face risks of centralization which can affect trust, potential security concerns due to fewer nodes, and limited innovation because of their closed nature."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Public blockchains are ideal for applications where transparency and decentralization are needed, such as cryptocurrencies, dApps, and smart contracts. Private blockchains are suited for enterprises requiring control and confidentiality, like banking, healthcare, and exclusive supply chain management."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Hybrid blockchains, or consortium blockchains, combine elements of both public and private blockchains. They are managed by a group of organizations, offering partial decentralization with privacy and control, suitable for shared environments like consortium supply chains."

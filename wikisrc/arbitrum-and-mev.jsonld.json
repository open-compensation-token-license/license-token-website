      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "MEV refers to the profit miners can make by changing the order or inclusion of transactions within blocks, which can affect network stability and fairness. It is important because it poses challenges to the security and integrity of decentralized finance (DeFi)."

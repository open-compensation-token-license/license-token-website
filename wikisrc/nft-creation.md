# Exploring NFT Creation: A Step-by-Step Guide

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have revolutionized the worlds of art, gaming, and real estate by offering new ways to own, sell, and authenticate digital assets. This guide delves into the NFT creation process, from understanding their origins to exploring their future implications across various industries.

## Discovering NFTs

NFTs are unique cryptographic assets on blockchains that represent ownership of digital items, contrasting fungible counterparts like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Initially gaining traction with projects like [Cryptopunks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks) and [CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/) in 2017, NFTs now span multiple sectors, making significant impacts in the digital world.

## How to Create NFTs

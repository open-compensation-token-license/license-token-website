It ensures developers are compensated for their efforts, promoting sustainability and innovation in the open-source ecosystem."

            "text": "Open-source software powers much of the world's digital infrastructure, such as Linux, Apache, and Node.js. Without proper funding, developers risk burnout, projects may stagnate due to lack of resources, and critical software dependencies might stay unmaintained, causing security and performance issues. Patronage ensures developers can continue their work and maintain these vital projects."

High-profile projects like React or Kubernetes often attract significant sponsorship, while smaller but essential projects may struggle for support. Raising awareness and encouraging more organizations to sponsor developers are key to solving this issue."

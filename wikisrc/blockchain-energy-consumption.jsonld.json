        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Blockchain is a decentralized ledger technology that uses cryptography to ensure secure and transparent transactions. It is most commonly known for its use in digital currencies like Bitcoin, which uses a Proof of Work (PoW) model. This model requires significant computational power, leading to substantial energy consumption."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The energy-intensive nature of the Proof of Work model used by blockchains like Bitcoin has led to sustainability concerns. Bitcoin's annual energy consumption is comparable to that of some nations, raising issues about its environmental impact, particularly given the use of non-renewable energy sources like coal."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "To reduce the environmental impact, the blockchain community is exploring alternatives such as transitioning to Proof of Stake (PoS), which uses a stake-based transaction validation process that requires less energy. Initiatives like Ethereum 2.0 and the use of renewable energy sources, like hydroelectric power, are also being explored."

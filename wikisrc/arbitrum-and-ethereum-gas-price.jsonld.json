      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Ethereum's gas fees, measured in Gwei, are essential for conducting transactions and executing smart contracts. Due to the network's demand and its Proof of Work (PoW) mechanism, gas prices can be high, particularly during peak periods, making transactions costly."

## 7. Utilize the Blockchain License Model in Bangalore

The standardized Blockchain License platform provides a simple, fair approach for token distribution. Here is an example model for allocating tokens:

markdown
Total_Tokens = S + C + M

Where:
- S = Sponsor Contribution Tokens
- C = Contributor Earnings
- M = Maintainer Earnings

For each contributor or maintainer i, calculate a weighted score:

Weighted_Score_i = (LOC_i * wLOC) + (IssuesFixed_i * wISS) + (DocsContrib_i * wDOC)

Then, determine each individual’s share from C or M:

Share_i = (Weighted_Score_i / Σ Weighted_Score_all) * (C or M)


### Advantages for Bangalore Contributors
1. **Incentivized Work**: Token holders have a vested interest in the project’s success, ensuring continuous engagement.
2. **Stronger Community Ties**: A transparent, blockchain-based framework strengthens the local open source ecosystem by promoting collaboration.
3. **Shared Decision-Making**: Sponsors, maintainers, and contributors collectively define the project roadmap, aligning with Bangalore’s collaborative culture.

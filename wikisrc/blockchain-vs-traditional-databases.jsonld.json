      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Blockchain provides full transparency and easy auditability, enhancing trust and traceability, unlike traditional databases, which require complex integrations for similar audit capabilities."

      "name": "What are the cost implications of using blockchain versus traditional databases?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "While traditional databases are cost-effective for high-speed transactions, they can incur high infrastructure costs. Blockchain can reduce intermediary costs but might be expensive to set up and operate, especially for public blockchains."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Traditional databases offer centralized governance which is beneficial for compliance and oversight. In contrast, blockchain democratizes control but can make governance challenging in regulated industries."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Layer 2 solutions process transactions off-chain, reducing congestion on the Ethereum blockchain. They batch transactions to maintain Ethereum's security while increasing throughput. Arbitrum and Optimism are among the leading solutions offering unique approaches to enhance scalability."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Arbitrum, developed by Offchain Labs, uses Optimistic Rollups to facilitate fast, secure, and affordable Ethereum transactions off-chain. Results are periodically reported to the Ethereum mainnet, ensuring scalability, EVM compatibility, and security through fraud proofs."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Optimism also employs Optimistic Rollups but focuses on simplicity to minimize errors and facilitate auditing. It reduces transaction costs through off-chain processing and emphasizes open governance and community input, differing from Arbitrum's multi-round fraud-proof system."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Permissive licenses, such as MIT and Apache, allow software to be used with minimal restrictions, including integration into proprietary software. Copyleft licenses, like GPL, require derivatives to maintain the same licensing terms, ensuring the software remains open source."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, changing the license is possible, but it depends on the existing contributors and the terms of the current license. If you are the sole author, you can relicense. With multiple contributors, their consent is required, or you must adhere to the original license."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "While they often overlap, open source licenses focus on practical software freedom aspects, whereas free software licenses emphasize ethical and philosophical software freedom. Many licenses qualify as both."

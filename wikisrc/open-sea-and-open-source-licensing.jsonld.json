      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Intellectual property challenges in the NFT space arise from the decentralized nature of blockchain transactions. NFTs, while representing unique ownership of digital works, do not inherently confer IP rights like copyright, creating a complex interplay between protection and openness. This poses challenges in aligning NFT ownership with the principles of open-source licensing."

Adopting open-source principles of transparency and accountability can aid in addressing these ethical concerns."

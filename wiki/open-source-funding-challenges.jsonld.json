          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Many users, particularly enterprises, rely on open source software without understanding the resources and efforts needed to maintain it. They often assume open source projects are self-sustaining."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Monetizing open source projects is challenging because of the ethos of free software. Developers face backlash from the community when introducing monetization models like licensing, and scaling such efforts remains difficult."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Critical but less visible parts of the open source stack often go unnoticed until major issues arise, while funding tends to favor high-profile projects. This leaves less glamorous work underfunded."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Corporations often rely heavily on open source but only a small subset give back financially. When they contribute, they prioritize high-visibility projects that align with their interests, leaving other projects underfunded."

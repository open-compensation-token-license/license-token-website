# Tesla and Open Source Licensing: Elon Musk's Vision

Tesla Inc., under the leadership of [Elon Musk](https://www.tesla.com/elon-musk), has adopted a unique open source philosophy for their patents. This approach is not just about fostering innovation but is intrinsically linked to their mission of promoting sustainable transport. In this article, we explore Tesla's groundbreaking move towards open source licensing, its impacts on the automotive industry, and the challenges that accompany this trailblazing strategy.

## The Beginning of an Open Source Movement

Elon Musk announced in 2014 that Tesla would release its electric vehicle patents to the public. This decision marked a radical departure from traditional business models that focus heavily on guarding intellectual property. Musk's reasoning was simple: encourage the proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs) to accelerate sustainable transport—a step necessary to combat climate change.

## Open Source Licensing Defined

Open source licensing allows users to access, modify, and share a company’s intellectual property freely. This concept, applied in Tesla’s case, encourages innovation by breaking down barriers within the industry. Tesla's hope is that by sharing their technology, the industry can work collaboratively to advance EV development without fear of litigation.

# Secure Your NFTs: Essential Storage Solutions

In the digital age, securing Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) has become essential for collectors and investors alike. Understanding how and where to store these valuable digital assets can protect them from loss and cyber threats. Hereâ€™s a comprehensive guide to NFT storage solutions.

## NFT Storage Solutions

### 1. **Digital Wallets**

- **Software Wallets**: Convenient for everyday use, with options like [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) and [Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com/). For more on NFT wallets, explore [What is an NFT Wallet](https://www.license-token.com/wiki/what-is-an-nft-wallet).
- **Hardware Wallets**: More secure, offline alternatives, such as [Ledger Nano](https://shop.ledger.com/pages/ledger-nano-x) and [Trezor](https://trezor.io/).

### 2. **InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)**

- **Secure USB Drives**: Store encrypted keys offline, but ensure robust encryption and secure physical storage.

### 4. **Custodial Solutions**

Platforms like [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) offer custodial services, though they require trust in a third party. To understand the value of NFTs, check out [Why Are NFTs Valuable](https://www.license-token.com/wiki/why-are-nf-ts-valuable).

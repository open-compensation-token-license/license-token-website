        "@type": "Answer",

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Optimistic rollups assume all transactions are valid and use a 'challenge' period to allow for dispute of any incorrect transactions. This 'challenge' period, typically set at seven days, affects the withdrawal times."

      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Why does Arbitrum have a seven-day challenge period for withdrawals?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The seven-day challenge period ensures security by allowing enough time to contest any suspicious transactions, thus maintaining the integrity and security of the network."

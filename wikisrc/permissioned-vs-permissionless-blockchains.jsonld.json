      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The core differences include accessibility and participation, with permissionless networks encouraging open participation while permissioned networks restrict access. Governance is decentralized in permissionless systems and centralized within permissioned frameworks. Security and trust are achieved through consensus mechanisms in permissionless blockchains, while vetted participation provides a different layer of trust in permissioned systems."

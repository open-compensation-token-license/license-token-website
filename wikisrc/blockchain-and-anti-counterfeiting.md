# Exploring the Role of Blockchain in Combating Counterfeiting

Counterfeiting is a critical issue in the global economy, plaguing industries from luxury goods to pharmaceuticals. The potential of [blockchain technology](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp) in addressing this issue is gaining recognition for its transparency and security features.

## Blockchain Basics 

Blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger publicly recording every transaction across a distributed network, making any alteration nearly impossible without detection. For more on blockchain technology, see [What is Blockchain](https://www.license-token.com/wiki/what-is-blockchain).

## Counterfeiting Concerns

Counterfeiting causes significant losses and poses dangers to consumers, particularly with counterfeit drugs and unsafe electronics, due to opaque supply chains and weak verification systems.

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Arbitrum is a pioneering layer 2 solution designed to optimize Ethereum's transaction capabilities through an optimistic rollup mechanism. It processes transactions off-chain and posts only results on-chain, allowing developers to maintain Ethereum's security while increasing transaction speed and reducing costs."

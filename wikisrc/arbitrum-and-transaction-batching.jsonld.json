        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Arbitrum uses optimistic rollups to bundle multiple transactions into a single batch processed off-chain, with the summarized batch recorded on the Ethereum network. It maintains integrity with a dispute resolution mechanism in case of fraudulent activity."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Transaction batching is the process of combining multiple transactions into a single batch, which enhances Ethereumâ€™s performance by decreasing workload and resource use on the blockchain."

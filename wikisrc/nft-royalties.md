# The Evolving Landscape of NFT Royalties: New Opportunities for Creators and Investors

## Understanding NFTs: A Brief Overview

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are unique digital assets that leverage blockchain technology to ensure [scarcity, provenance, and ownership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token). Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, NFTs are non-fungible, making them ideal for representing digital art, music, and more. These tokens, verified through blockchain, allow transactions to occur securely and transparently.

## NFT Royalties: The Concept and Mechanisms

NFT royalties refer to the payments made to creators whenever their NFTs are resold. This revolutionary system, akin to music or literary royalties, is enabled by [smart contracts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-contracts.asp). For example, an artist can set a 10% royalty on an NFT, receiving automatic compensation every time it resells.

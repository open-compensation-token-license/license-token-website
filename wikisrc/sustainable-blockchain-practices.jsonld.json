        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Traditional blockchain systems, especially those using Proof of Work (PoW), consume massive amounts of energy. For instance, Bitcoin mining's energy consumption can be compared to that of entire countries, leading to significant carbon emissions and potentially threatening decentralization by favoring resource-rich participants."

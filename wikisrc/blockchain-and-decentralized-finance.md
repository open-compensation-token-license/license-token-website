# Blockchain and Decentralized Finance: Revolutionizing the Financial Landscape

## What is Blockchain?

Blockchain, introduced in 2009 with Bitcoin by Satoshi Nakamoto, is a distributed ledger technology that records transactions across multiple computers to prevent alterations. It decentralizes control among nodes, ensuring security and trust.

### Features of Blockchain

1. **Decentralization** - Control is distributed among many nodes, enhancing security.
2. **Transparency** - All transactions are visible, reducing fraud.
3. **Immutability** - Recorded transactions cannot be changed.
4. **Security** - Uses cryptography to protect against unauthorized access.

## Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

DeFi replicates and improves upon traditional financial systems using blockchain. Built on networks like Ethereum, it offers services like lending and trading without intermediaries.

### Components of DeFi

1. **Smart Contracts** - Automate and enforce contracts without third parties.
2. **DApps** - Run on decentralized networks to offer financial services.
3. **DEXs** - Enable direct trading between users.
4. **Stablecoins** - Cryptocurrencies with value pegged to real-world assets.
5. **Yield Farming** - Earn rewards by providing liquidity to DeFi platforms.

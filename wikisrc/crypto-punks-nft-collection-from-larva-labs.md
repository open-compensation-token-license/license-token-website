## Introduction

CryptoPunks are a collection of 10,000 unique, algorithmically generated 24x24 pixel art characters. Each Punk has distinct attributes and is stored on the Ethereum blockchain, making them tradable and verifiable as digital assets. As one of the earliest NFT projects, CryptoPunks have set the standard for digital collectibles, influencing numerous subsequent NFT projects and the broader digital art landscape.

## History of CryptoPunks

The CryptoPunks project was launched in June 2017 by two software developers, Matt Hall and John Watkinson, under their company Larva Labs. Initially available for free to anyone with an Ethereum wallet, CryptoPunks quickly garnered attention within the crypto community. The project's limited supply and unique, algorithmically generated characters established CryptoPunks as a rare and valuable digital collectible.

In June 2021, Larva Labs released CryptoPunks V2, moving the Punks to be fully owned by their owners, enhancing the community's control over the assets. This move was pivotal in solidifying the CryptoPunks' status as a key player in the NFT space.

## Features of the Collection

### Unique Attributes

Each CryptoPunk has a unique combination of attributes, such as hairstyles, accessories, and facial features. These attributes determine the rarity and value of each Punk. Some of the most coveted attributes include:

- **Alien and Ape Punks:** Only 24 and 100 of these exist, respectively, making them the rarest.
- **Zombie Punks:** Comprising 88 unique characters.
- **Other Accessories:** Including smoking pipes, hats, glasses, and earrings.

### Algorithmic Generation

CryptoPunks are generated using an algorithm that ensures each Punk is distinct. This randomness contributes to the unique appeal of each character, as no two Punks are identical.

### Ownership and Provenance

Stored on the Ethereum blockchain, ownership of CryptoPunks is transparent and immutable. Each transaction is recorded, providing a verifiable history of ownership and authenticity.

### Metadata

Each CryptoPunk's metadata includes its attributes and its image hash, ensuring that the digital art is uniquely identifiable and cannot be tampered with.

## Creation by Larva Labs

### Development Process

The development of CryptoPunks involved creating a generative algorithm that would produce 10,000 unique characters. The algorithm randomly assigns various attributes to each Punk, ensuring a diverse and varied collection. The entire collection was minted with no pre-sale, fostering a sense of community and decentralized ownership.

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Arbitrum is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum designed to improve the platform's transaction throughput without compromising security and decentralization. It achieves this by processing transactions off-chain and then consolidating them onto the Ethereum mainnet, thus enhancing speed and reducing costs."

      "name": "What scalability challenges does Ethereum face?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Ethereum faces scalability issues due to its architecture, which supports approximately 15 transactions per second. This limitation leads to network congestion, high transaction fees, and delayed confirmations, especially during high demand periods."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Layer 2 solutions are designed to operate on top of the Ethereum mainnet and offload transactions from it. This reduces congestion, lowers transaction costs, and increases execution speed while retaining Ethereum's security and decentralization."

      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What is the core technology behind Arbitrum?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Arbitrum is an optimistic rollup, which assumes transactions are valid by default and posts them on Ethereum. It uses fraud proofs to challenge any potentially incorrect transactions. This design allows Arbitrum to process a high number of transactions efficiently."

      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What advantages does Arbitrum provide?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Arbitrum offers reduced transaction costs, increased transaction speeds, seamless integration for developers due to its EVM compatibility, and community-driven governance. These advantages make it appealing for those seeking scalability solutions on Ethereum."

      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What challenges does Arbitrum face?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Arbitrum faces challenges related to the centralization of sequencers, which could pose risks if not managed. Additionally, the mechanism for handling fraudulent transactions might introduce delays, though these occurrences are expected to be rare."

      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "How does Arbitrum fit into the larger Ethereum ecosystem?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Arbitrum is part of a range of Layer 2 solutions like Polygon, zkSync, and Optimism, each contributing to the scalability of Ethereum. These solutions complement each other and work alongside Ethereum's proposed improvements like Ethereum 2.0 to enhance blockchain efficiency."

      "name": "What is the future of Arbitrum?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Arbitrum's future includes plans to increase decentralization, enhance user experiences, and reduce costs further. The launch of Arbitrum Nitro aims to increase throughput and lower fees. As Ethereum evolves towards version 2.0, Arbitrum will need to align its strategies with Ethereum's architectural changes."

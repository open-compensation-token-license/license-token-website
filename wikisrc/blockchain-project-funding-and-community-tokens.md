# Exploring Blockchain Project Funding with Community Tokens

In the dynamic world of blockchain, funding and community engagement are revolutionizing decentralized finance (DeFi). The advent of community tokens is democratizing project finance, offering stakeholders a sense of ownership and active involvement. This exploration delves into the transformative role of community tokens in blockchain project funding.

## Delving into Blockchain Project Funding

### Evolution from ICOs to IEOs and STOs

**Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs)** were once a staple, marked by speculative risks and regulatory scrutiny. In response, **Initial Exchange Offerings (IEOs)** and **Security Token Offerings (STOs)** emerged, introducing layers of trust, regulation, and institutional interest, yet limiting retail investor access.

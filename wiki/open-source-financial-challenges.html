However, maintaining these projects involves costs related to hosting, testing, security, and compensating contributors. This lack of funding often leads to stagnation or burnout among maintainers."

Additionally, companies are starting to recognize the value of open source tools by contributing through initiatives like Google’s Open Source Security Team or Microsoft’s sponsorship programs. Foundations like the Apache and Linux Foundations also provide financial and operational support."

Users and corporations must understand that investing in open source projects ensures long-term innovation and reliability. Increasing visibility, encouraging funding, and balancing open-source principles with practical support systems are key steps."

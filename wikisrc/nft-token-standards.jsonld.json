        "text": "NFTs, or Non-Fungible Tokens, are unique digital assets that represent ownership of distinct items like art, collectibles, or virtual real estate. Unlike fungible tokens such as cryptocurrencies, each NFT has unique properties making them ideal for representing singular digital assets. They are significant because they offer new ways for creators to monetize their work and for collectors to invest in digital assets."

        "text": "ERC-998 enables the creation of composable NFTs, which can own other ERC-721 or ERC-20 tokens. It facilitates complex asset structures by supporting parent-child relationships and advanced composability, making it ideal for intricate collectibles and digital environments."

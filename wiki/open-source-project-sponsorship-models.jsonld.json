This financial backing can fund part-time or full-time work, cover operational costs, or support community events, thereby preventing maintainers from burnout and sustaining the project's growth."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Corporate sponsorships provide financial support, infrastructure, or employees to open source projects.

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Dual licensing is a model where a project is available both under an open source license and a separate commercial license. This allows companies to monetize their software from commercial clients while maintaining an open source version. Projects like MongoDB and Qt effectively employ dual licensing to generate income and contribute to the open source community."

Transparency is important for sponsors to understand how funds are used, while maintainers should provide regular project updates. Setting realistic funding goals and deliverables builds trust and encourages support. Successful sponsorships require mutual respect, shared goals, and an understanding of the project's importance beyond immediate business benefits."

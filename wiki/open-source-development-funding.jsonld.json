          "text": "Funding matters for open source because contributors often rely on volunteer efforts, which can lead to burnout. Building and maintaining high-quality software is time-intensive, requiring long-term commitments for fixing bugs, ensuring security, creating documentation, and more. Sustainable funding ensures developers can dedicate their time and resources to these tasks, ensuring the quality and security of software that commercial products and services heavily rely on."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Crowdfunding is a method of raising small amounts of money from a large number of people via online platforms like Kickstarter, Indiegogo, and Patreon. It allows developers to present their projects to the public and solicit contributions, often offering incentives such as early access or participation in project features. Crowdfunding can benefit open-source projects by enabling direct community engagement and validation."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Donations provide a direct funding stream from users to open-source projects. Platforms like Open Collective and GitHub Sponsors allow individuals and corporations to contribute financially to projects. While donations may not always offer stable income, they help foster a deeper connection between users and developers."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Sponsorships and grants are critical forms of funding from corporations and institutions. Companies like Google, Microsoft, and IBM, as well as foundations like Mozilla and Linux Foundation, offer financial support and resources for projects that align with their strategic goals. These not only provide financial aid but also mentorship and technical resources."

      "name": "What is dual licensing and how does it assist in funding open-source projects?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Dual licensing involves releasing a project under both an open-source and a commercial license. This model keeps the project free for personal and educational use but charges for commercial use. It balances open-source principles with financial needs, exemplified by MySQL's community and paid enterprise editions."

      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "How do service and support models generate revenue for open-source projects?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Open-source projects, particularly in enterprise software, can monetize by offering paid professional services like support, custom development, and training. Companies like Red Hat and Canonical have used this model to secure reliable, recurring revenue while providing assurance of expert support to businesses."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Dual licensing involves releasing a project under both an open-source and a commercial license. This model keeps the project free for personal and educational use but charges for commercial use. It balances open-source principles with financial needs, exemplified by MySQL's community and paid enterprise editions."

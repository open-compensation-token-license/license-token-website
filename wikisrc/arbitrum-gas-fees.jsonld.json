        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Arbitrum is a Layer 2 scaling solution built on Optimistic Rollups, which processes transactions off-chain while maintaining decentralization and security. This approach helps lower gas fees and enhance transaction speeds on the Ethereum network."

      "name": "How do gas fees work on Arbitrum?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Gas fees on Arbitrum are managed through batching transactions into single rollups, dynamic fee adjustments based on network demand, and the roles of validators and sequencers in processing and securing transactions."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Lower gas fees on Arbitrum make decentralized finance (DeFi) more accessible by reducing transaction costs, thereby lowering entry barriers for both users and developers."

      "name": "How does Arbitrum compare to other Layer 2 solutions like Polygon and Optimism?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Arbitrum, like Optimism, uses Optimistic Rollups for scaling, emphasizing transaction cost reduction and speed enhancement. Polygon offers multiple solutions with varying balances of security and decentralization, while zk-Rollups provide great security but face compatibility challenges."
